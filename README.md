Project Name: Udacity VR Apartment
Developer: Russell Alleen-Willems
Platform: Google Cardboard
Time for Project Completion: 12 hours
Build Date: 8/22/2017

Software Versions:
GVR Version: 1.0
Unity Version: 5.5.1f1

Description:
This Google Cardboard app simulates a small apartment in VR. The project demonstrates the use of VR cameras, 3D models, and lighting techniques optimized for low-power VR devices (e.g. phones).

One Thing I Liked:
I had a lot of fun placing the props in the scene and designing a nice virtual environment for myself. I spent the bulk of the dev time just having fun placing furniture and customizing my "VR" apartment.

One Challenge:
I had some challenges figuring out how best to adjust the scene lighting. Baked lights appear much brighter than real-time lights of the same intensity and the lighting appears darker when deployed to mobile.
